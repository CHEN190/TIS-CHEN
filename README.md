Project Intro:
Milling process is one of the common processing methods in mechanical manufacturing industry. 
The tool wear of milling tools causes a significant impact on the accuracy and yield of metal machining products. 
In the case replacing worn tools has become one of the companies’ decisions to maintain the quality in finished products. 
However, the strategy of tool replacement needs to be determined with reference to the evaluation of the wear level. It will directly affect milling tool life. 
Therefore, in this research, the wear mechanism and standards should follow the rules of International Standards Organization. 
Develop scientifically defined quantitative classification standards, and provide processing industry classification models including wear patterns and wear values and other decision-making indicators.
In view of the fact that the four-flute end mill is the most commonly used for milling in machining factories, so this research will focus on the four-flute end mill as the main research object. This research will take over the automated optical inspection system which set up previously. To optimize the algorithm and hardware system, in order to achieve higher system resolution and rapid inspection requirements. Analyze the different wear patterns and condition value on the tools. 
The analysis feature will feed the supervised machine learning model for doing multicategory tool life classification. 
So that the decision makers in the machine processing industry can apply this quantitative classification model replacing the original manual detection and judgment which is depend on the master’s personal judgement. 
Develop an objective quantified standard life grading method to milling cutter.
